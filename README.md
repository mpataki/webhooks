This repo is more or less a dummy rails app that I'm using to learn production server provisioning and configuration, as well as some CI stuff. It's called `webhooks` as it may, one day, be used for webhooks. Until then, it will just server up some simple canned responses for testing purposes.

#### Version bumping
- To version bump and tag, merge master into the `release` branch.
